While learning JavaScript, I created several small games and projects to strengthen my understanding of the language. Each project focuses on different concepts such as DOM manipulation, events, arrays, objects, and asynchronous programming. Building these projects not only improved my problem-solving skills but also gave me practical experience in writing clean, interactive, and functional code.
